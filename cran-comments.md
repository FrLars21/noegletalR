## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed single quotes in the package title and description for the strings: 'Tibbles', 'Noegletal' and 'noegletal.dk'.

* Added a link to noegletal.dk in the package description.

* Added a working example for noegletal_tidy() using the inst/ext folder + removed the \dontrun{} directive.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
